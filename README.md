As a devoted football enthusiast and data aficionado, I'm always eager to explore the fascinating intersection of Data Science and Engineering within the realm of sports. Excited to unveil my debut data engineering project utilizing Python, Prefect, and Power BI.

🔍 Project Overview:
- Python: The backbone for data processing (ELT).
- Prefect: Driving data orchestration.
- Power BI: A scalable, machine learning-infused business intelligence (BI) service.

🎯 Project Objectives:
- Data Acquisition: Leveraged datasets from https://www.football-data.co.uk/, focusing on League statistics.
- Transformation: Renamed and created columns to address specific questions.
- Orchestration: Utilized Prefect cron to run the pipeline daily at 12 pm.
- Analytics Output: Developed a dashboard answering key questions, including teams with the most wins and losses, match evolution, league table, and referee insights.

📊 Highlights:
- Data Source: https://www.football-data.co.uk/
- Questions Addressed: Wins and losses, match evolution, league table, referees, and team card statistics.
